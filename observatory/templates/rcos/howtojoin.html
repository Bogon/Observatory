<h1>How to Join RCOS</h1>
<h2> Guide for noob <a href="https://github.com/rcos/Observatory/wiki/Guide-for-noob"> Guide for noob</a></h2>
The process to join RCOS has two main components, an RCOS proposal, and a URP proposal.
<h2>RCOS Proposal</h2>
The proposal process is very important. A well written proposal lays the ground work for a successful RCOS project. The proposal should include an overview of the project, your semester-long goals, and a "task list" of very detailed items that you will accomplish in the first few weeks of the semester. Similar task lists should be created throughout the semester. Your RCOS proposal must be submitted at least a week earlier than the deadline ).
Please see this <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OSIXGpfvU2XIDZlYTA5nA9cYbegV7zKUuMu9qLRFgDc/edit> Details </a>
<br />
We will review your proposal within a week, and ask for revisions if necessary. This will allow you one week to re-submit the proposal along with the URP proposal (see below).
Please follow the guide lines.
<h2>URP Proposal</h2>
Once RCOS has approved your project, you will need to write a condensed form of the proposal to submit to RPI. Please submit a <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/dept/cct/apps/undergrad/resources/PDFs/URP_Application_2010.pdf">URP proposal form</a> to paslowp@cs.rpi.edu Ms. Pam Paslowor give it to her in MRC 304 by XYZ (the official URP deadline).

<h2> Deadline </h2>
<p>
To apply for Spring 2013 URP, please apply on or before January 28th, 2013 
</p>

<h2>Compensation Decision</h2>
Compensation for your work on an RCOS project comes in one of two forms: a stipend or course credit.
<h3>Stipend</h3>
The Fall/Spring semester stipend is $1200. The Summer term stipend is $3500. 

<h3>Course Credit</h3>
Typically you can apply for 3 or 4 credits for an RCOS URP. The expected amount of work is N + 3*N where N = the number of credits applied for.
